Automatic Online Multi-source Domain Adaptation

1. Download the code into your computer.

2. Open Matlab. The code was developed using Matlab 2018b, so if you use an older version, you might get some incompability errors.

3. Run the code by 'Main.m' file.

4. Switch the dataset you want by turning on the code 'dm.load***Dataset();'.



Thank you.
